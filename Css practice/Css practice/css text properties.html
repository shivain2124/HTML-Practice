        Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living <a href="/somewhere">species</a> are currently recognised: the African bush
        elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family
        Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features
        of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but
        sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks,
        which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The
        large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants
        have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

    <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
    <p>
        Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass, and roots. African elephants mostly
        browse, while Asian elephants mainly graze.[35] They can eat as much as 300 kg (660 lb) of food and drink 40 L
        (11 US gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources.[35][87] They have morning, afternoon,
        and nighttime feeding sessions. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping
        occurs at night while the animal is lying down.[87] Elephants average4 hours of sleep per day.[88] Both males
        and family groups typically move no more than 20 km (12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 180 km (112 mi) have
        been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia.[89] Elephants go on seasonal migrations in response to changes in
        environmental conditions

    <h3>Social organisation</h3>
    <p>

        A family of African bush elephants
        Elephants are generally gregarious animals. African bush elephants in particular have a complex, stratified
        social structure.[100] Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups.[101]
        They are led by the matriarch, who is often the eldest female.[102] She remains leader of the group until
        death[95] or if she no longer has the energy for the role;[103] a study on zoo elephants found that the death of
        the matriarch led to greater stress in the surviving elephants.[104] When her tenure is over, the matriarch's
        eldest daughter takes her place instead of her sister (if present).[95] One study found that younger matriarchs
        take potential threats less seriously.[105] Large family groups may split if they cannot be supported by local
        resources.[10
